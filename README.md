# Auto Capitalise File Names â€“ Obsidian Plugin

Automatically capitalise your Obsidian file names to Sentence case or Title Case as you create or modify notes.

## Features

- **Automatic renaming:** Newly created and modified files are automatically renamed to your chosen capitalisation style.
- **Configurable capitalisation mode:** Choose between Sentence case (e.g., "My new note") or Title Case (e.g., "My New Note").
- **Delay for new files:** Set a delay (in milliseconds) before renaming new files, to allow for initial edits.
- **Live preview:** See a live example in the settings tab when you change your capitalisation mode.
